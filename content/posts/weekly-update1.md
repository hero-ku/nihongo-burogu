+++

This is the first of a series of Weekly Updates covering the progress I made on Japanese within the week.
I'll also be going on random tangents of things I realized or came across.

## Vocabulary

I started this blog last week because I recently returned to Japanese. I had previously used the Kaishi 1.5k Anki deck for a month on-and-off, learning a few hundred (maybe 300?) words.
I returned to it here and there but after the first month never made any significant progress. I'm excited to announce that I now have a 9-day streak!
Obviously this is a measly number, but it's much better than the streaks of like 3 days that I was getting every few months after my initial month of Anki.

I started off with 10 new words per day, and bumped it up to 15 within the last few days. This morning I changed it to 20 before doing my reviews. I'd like to get through Kaishi and the beginner stage as fast as possible, and this will allow me to do it in around two months from now.

## Immersion

This is the main thing I have to talk about.
Last week, I set a goal of getting in 10 hours of listening immersion by the end of the week.
I did immerse, but I only got around 7 hours. I'm a little disappointed, but this is leagues better than the 0 immersion I was doing when I first started learning.

I started the week with 2 episodes of *Ao no Hako* (Blue Box), an anime that I had watched some of before.
Immersing with this show was fine. It's a sports anime/rom-com with a lot of action and a straightforward plot.
The Japanese is probably pretty simple, although at this stage, it's not like I can understand most of it anyway.

I quickly switched to watching *Erased*, one of my all-time favorite anime that I watched six years ago. It's a fairly complex show, but the Japanese didn't seem to be that difficult, and most importantly, it was pretty fun. I was able to keep up with plot using my shakey memory and by gleaning some words and sentences here and there. I definitely felt like this is the first time immersion really worked in the way it was supposed to, and I think I made progress with understanding how a lot of words I learned in the Kaishi are used in context.

After finishing *Erased*, I decided I should switch to something with a simpler storyline and thus more comprehensible input. I started watching *Love Live! School Idol Project* and got through the first 9 episodes. The initial period of watching this show was a game-changer for me. The show was extremely fast-paced and could keep my attention without requiring me to understand the language. I felt like I finally understood the secret to immersion. Unfortunately, I did lose track of the plot a bit more towards the end of Season 1: Part 1, and it got harder to pay attention to.

Something I've finally started to understand about the immersion method is how much it hinges on you enjoying your immersion. Previously, I was most interested in the method simply because of claims that it was the more efficient way to learn the language, and wasn't really interested in the immersion process so much as seeing results. I bought into the process on the pretense that I would just have enough motivation to blow through tons of immersion. This obviously isn't true. Immersion can suck, bad. Right now, I'm still trying to figure out how to make it suck less. It was extremely hard for me to watch a lot of raw anime in one day without getting bored or too tired to continue at all.

Immersion has to be something you *want* to come back to.

** Conclusion

That's the end of this weekly report. These might get longer in the future, but I'm really tired and want to go to bed.
I've decided that I'm going to start getting to sleep earlier so I can wake up before my classes start and get through Anki.

I've changed my approach to immersion, and am now aiming to immerse whenever I have free time, completely eliminating English language content.

My goal for this week is 14 hours of listening immersion.
See you then.

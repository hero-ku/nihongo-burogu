                    <h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>This is my new blog that I&rsquo;ve created to record progress in learning Japanese. I&rsquo;ve barely started so far, mostly just bouncing from method to method, trying to figure out what to do in a sea of information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making this blog for myself, but feel free to stick around if you&rsquo;re looking to measure another learner&rsquo;s progress and compare results.</p>
<h2 id="where-i-am">Where I am</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in learning Japanese for around 4 years. In 2021, I picked up some familiarity with the hiragana syllabary.
I didn&rsquo;t exercise it much and ultimately forgot about the language for 2 years.</p>
<p>I came back to the language in 2023 when I decided to start learning properly.
I read the complete guide to learning Japanese from Tofugu (<a href="https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/">https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/</a>) and got started with WaniKani. I did this completely inconsistently, picking up my phone at random with weeks in between to go through individual radicals, kanji and <em>occasionally</em> words. I kept doing this until one day (in the summer of 2024) I stumbled upon the website at <a href="https://learnjapanese.moe">https://learnjapanese.moe</a> (called TheMoeWay). I stayed up a long time that night debating on whether to
attempt the switch.</p>
<p>TheMoeWay promotes the immersion method: surrounding yourself in native Japanese content meant for natives to improve comprehension. The idea is that most of language resides not in easily researchable words
and grammar, but in the particular patterns of its speakers that can only be acquired with constant exposure. Basically, the best way to get good at listening to Japanese is listen to it, and the best way to get good at reading it is to read it. But first, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to prime yourself on the first thousand common words as a starting point in your immersion. I ended up succumbing to the promises it made and loading their <a href="https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi">Kaishi 1.5k</a> vocabulary deck into <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>.</p>
<p>I studied Kaishi for about a month on-and-off, with my longest streak at 8 days. That remains my longest streak.
I picked up a few hundred pieces of vocabulary and mostly remember them (SRS works!).</p>
<p>I dropped Japanese for a long time after starting university and have decided to commit myself to it once again.
I&rsquo;m sticking with the immersion method for now and am going to resume the Kaishi 1.5k. Today, I went to do my Anki, but got sidetracked by concerns over developing proper pitch accent. I decided to divert my attention to some research over whether I should be focusing on it at this stage, and am slightly conflicted. Notable Japanese-language creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dogen">Dogen</a> made a video several years ago about Japanese phonetics and the importance of perfecting your accent early. He suggested temporarily putting grammar and vocabulary study on hold just to work on your pronunciation, or else risk getting stuck with a gaijin accent for a long time. On the other hand, several successful Japanese learners have shared their opinions online that you can do perfectly fine without intention pitch-accent study at all. (Note: I&rsquo;ve also heard Dogen say that a ton of input can make up for lack of study, but that learners who want to output along their journey will benefit from intentional study).</p>
<h2 id="where-im-going">Where I&rsquo;m going</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to go for the middle ground: continuing listening immersion and vocabulary flashcards as normal but with daily pitch-accent/pronunciation practice.</p>
<p>My longish-term goal is to get <strong>200 hours</strong> of listening immersion by the end of the semester.<br>
My short-term goal is to get <strong>10 hours</strong> by the end of next week. (I&rsquo;ve probably only done a total of 3 hours of immersion so far in my life, and I&rsquo;m not counting those).</p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates (and hopefully progress).
OCD will be the death of me.</p>
